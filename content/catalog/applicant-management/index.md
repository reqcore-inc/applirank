Applicant Management features give recruiters everything they need to communicate with candidates and manage their journey through the hiring funnel — without leaving Reqcore.

These features are designed to centralise all candidate-facing interactions inside the platform, creating a full audit trail and eliminating the need to switch between email clients, phones, and the ATS.
