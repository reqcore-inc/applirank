Threaded comments on applications and candidates so hiring team members can share observations, flag concerns, and make collaborative decisions.

## What it solves

Without structured comments, feedback lives in Slack threads, email chains, and sticky notes. This makes it impossible to audit hiring decisions or understand why a candidate was rejected six months later. Threaded comments attached directly to the application create a permanent, searchable record.

## Planned implementation

- Threaded comments on application detail pages
- @mention team members for notifications
- Activity log per candidate showing all status changes, comments, and document uploads
- Role-based visibility (some comments visible to all, others restricted to hiring managers)
- Markdown formatting support in comments
