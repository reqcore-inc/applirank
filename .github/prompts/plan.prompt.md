description: Create a detailed implementation plan for a feature, starting with clarifying questions.
---
Briefly analyze my feature request below, then ask me 2-3 targeted questions to clarify the requirements. Focus on:
- Scope boundaries (what's in vs out)
- User-facing behavior expectations
- Any data model or security implications specific to multi-tenancy

Only after I answer your questions, proceed with the full planning workflow using the implementation plan template.
