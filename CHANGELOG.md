- **Internal link** — added cross-link from `self-hosted-vs-cloud-ats.md` to new pillar page

### Fixed

- **Railway PR seed execution** — removed hard `.env` dependency from `db:seed`; seeding now works with platform-injected env vars and still supports local `.env` loading in `seed.ts`

### Changed

- **Unified Railway seeding path** — Railway predeploy now runs `db:seed` (same script as standard demo data), removing PR-specific seed divergence between preview and production-like environments
- **Preview demo defaults aligned** — runtime preview fallbacks now target `reqcore-demo` and `demo@reqcore.com` to match `server/scripts/seed.ts`

### Removed

- **PR-only seed script** — removed `server/scripts/seed-pr.ts` and the `db:seed:pr` npm script

---
## 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Dependency security remediation** — resolved all `npm audit --audit-level=high` findings by upgrading `@aws-sdk/client-s3` (pulling patched `@aws-sdk/xml-builder`) and regenerating lockfile resolution
- **Transitive vulnerability pinning** — added npm `overrides` for `fast-xml-parser`, `minimatch`, `tar`, and `readdir-glob` to keep vulnerable transitive ranges out of the install graph
- **Demo write-protection enforcement** — hardened server demo guard so `POST`/`PATCH`/`PUT`/`DELETE` requests are consistently blocked for the configured demo organization and no longer silently fail open when demo org lookup fails
- **Dashboard preview UX** — write attempts in preview mode now trigger a dedicated upsell modal instead of only inline/API errors, while keeping action buttons visible

### Changed

- **Lockfile hygiene** — refreshed dependency graph with `npm install` + `npm dedupe` to remove stale vulnerable transitive entries
- **Demo env guidance** — `.env.example` demo slug example now matches seeded demo organization slug (`reqcore-demo`) to reduce configuration drift

---
## 2026-02-19

### Changed

- **Deployment platform migration** — migrated from Hetzner VPS (Caddy + systemd) to Railway (managed Nuxt service, Railway PostgreSQL, Railway Storage Buckets)
- **S3 path style now configurable** — `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` env var controls path-style vs virtual-hosted-style S3 URLs (MinIO vs Railway Buckets/AWS S3)
- **S3 bucket plugin** — skips bucket initialization on managed providers (Railway/AWS) where buckets are pre-provisioned
- **`.env.example`** — expanded with full documentation, Railway-specific variable references, and all env vars

### Added

- **`start` script in `package.json`** — `node .output/server/index.mjs` for Railway Nixpacks detection

---
## 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Organic SEO foundation** — `@nuxtjs/seo` (Sitemap, Robots, Schema.org, SEO Utils, Site Config) and `@nuxt/content` v3 (Markdown blog engine with typed collections)
- **Dynamic sitemap** — all open job postings auto-included via `/api/__sitemap__/urls`
- **Robots directives** — `/dashboard/`, `/auth/`, `/api/`, `/onboarding/` blocked from crawling; `noindex` on auth, onboarding, apply, and confirmation pages
- **JSON-LD structured data** — `JobPosting` on job detail (salary, location, remote, employment type), `Organization` + `WebSite` + `WebPage` on landing page, `Article` on blog posts
- **Job SEO fields** — `salaryMin`, `salaryMax`, `salaryCurrency`, `salaryUnit`, `remoteStatus`, `validThrough` added to job schema and all CRUD endpoints
- **Full OG + Twitter Card meta** on all public pages (landing, job board, job detail, roadmap, blog)
- **Blog** — listing page, article detail page with `@tailwindcss/typography` prose styling, seed article "Self-Hosted vs Cloud ATS: Pros, Cons, and When to Switch"
- **ISR route rules** — `/jobs/**` (3600s stale-while-revalidate), prerender for `/`, `/roadmap`, `/blog/**`
- **SVG favicon** — purple rounded rect with white "A"

### Changed

- **Landing page H1** — from "The recruitment engine you actually own" to "The open-source ATS you actually own" for keyword targeting
- **Landing page meta description** — optimized for "open source ATS", "self-hosted", "applicant tracking system" keywords
- **Public job API** — now joins organization table to expose `organizationName` for JSON-LD `hiringOrganization`
- **Navigation** — "Blog" link added to landing page navbar/footer and roadmap page navbar

---
## 2026-02-16

### Added

- **In-app feedback** — floating button in the dashboard opens a modal to submit bug reports or feature requests directly as GitHub Issues. Server-side GitHub API integration with fine-grained PAT (token never exposed to client). Per-user rate limiting (5/hour). Auto-labels issues (`bug` / `enhancement`). Includes reporter context (name, email, page URL). Gracefully hidden when `GITHUB_FEEDBACK_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_FEEDBACK_REPO` env vars are not set.
- **Production deployment** — deployed to Hetzner Cloud CX23 (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, Ubuntu 24.04) with Caddy reverse proxy, systemd service management, and one-command deploy script (`~/deploy.sh`)
- **Cloudflare CDN** — DNS, DDoS protection, edge caching, SSL termination (Full strict mode), and AI training bot blocking via Cloudflare Free plan
- **Deploy workflow** — `ssh deploy@server '~/deploy.sh'` pulls latest code, installs deps, builds, and restarts the systemd service
- **UFW firewall** — only ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS) open

### Fixed

- **S3 bucket policy MinIO compatibility** — replaced `PutBucketPolicy` with `DeleteBucketPolicy` because MinIO doesn't support the `aws:PrincipalType` condition key used in the deny-anonymous policy; buckets without a policy are private by default in MinIO

### Changed

- **S3 bucket privacy strategy** — instead of setting an explicit deny-all policy (which used AWS-only condition keys), the startup plugin now deletes any existing bucket policy to ensure MinIO's default private behavior

---
## 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Recruiter dashboard** (`app/pages/dashboard/index.vue`) — at-a-glance overview with four stat cards (Open Jobs, Total Candidates, Applications, Unreviewed), pipeline breakdown bar chart with color-coded status segments, jobs by status breakdown, recent applications list with relative timestamps, and top active jobs with new-application badges
- **Dashboard stats API** (`server/api/dashboard/stats.get.ts`) — single endpoint returning all dashboard data: summary counts, pipeline breakdown, jobs by status, recent 10 applications with candidate/job info, and top 5 active jobs by application count — all org-scoped with parallel query execution
- **Dashboard composable** (`app/composables/useDashboard.ts`) — wraps stats endpoint with computed unwrappers for all dashboard sections
- Quick action buttons (Create Job, Add Candidate) in dashboard header
- Welcome empty state for new organizations with CTA to create first job
- Loading skeleton states for all dashboard widgets
- **Public roadmap page** (`app/pages/roadmap.vue`) — cinematic horizontal-scrolling timeline with 15 glassmorphism milestone cards, color-coded by status (shipped/building/vision), scroll-tracking progress glow on the timeline axis, smooth mousewheel-to-horizontal scroll conversion via requestAnimationFrame, and intro card centered on page load
- **Roadmap showcase section on landing page** — "Built in the open" section with mini timeline showing Shipped/Building/Vision counts and prominent CTA to full roadmap
- **Roadmap navigation links** — Roadmap link added to landing page navbar and footer

---
## 2026-02-14

- **Sidebar icons** — all main nav items now display Lucide icons (LayoutDashboard, Briefcase, Users, Inbox, LogOut)
- **"All Jobs" sidebar back-link** — quick return to jobs list from any job sub-page

### Changed

- **Sidebar redesign** — replaced scoped CSS with Tailwind utility classes; added dynamic job context section with tab-based navigation
- **Dashboard layout** — removed `max-w-4xl` wrapper from `dashboard.vue`; each page now controls its own `mx-auto max-w-*` for proper centering
- **All dashboard pages** — added `mx-auto` to root elements for centered content within the main area
- **Dashboard index** — converted from `<style scoped>` to Tailwind utility classes
- **Job detail page** — removed "Back to Jobs" link, "View Pipeline" button, application link section, and Application Form Questions section (all moved to sidebar tabs / dedicated application-form page)
- **Pipeline page** — removed "Back to Job" link (sidebar provides navigation)

### Removed

- **"Back to X" links** on job sub-pages — sidebar now provides all navigation context
- **Scoped CSS** in `AppSidebar.vue` and `dashboard/index.vue` — replaced with Tailwind utilities
