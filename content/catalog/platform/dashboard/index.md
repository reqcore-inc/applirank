An at-a-glance overview showing the metrics that matter — open jobs, pipeline breakdown, recent applications, and top active positions.

## What it does

- Stat cards: Open Jobs, Total Candidates, Applications, Unreviewed — all clickable, linking to filtered views
- Pipeline overview widget — stacked bar visualization of candidates per stage
- Jobs by status widget — counts for draft, open, closed, archived
- Recent applications — last 10 with candidate name, job, status badge, and relative timestamps
- Top active jobs — 5 most active open positions ranked by application count
- Quick actions: "Create Job" and "Add Candidate" buttons
- Welcome empty state for new organizations with CTA to create first job
- Loading skeleton states for every widget
- Responsive 1-column (mobile) to 4-column (desktop) layout

## Why it matters

Recruiters need to answer "what needs my attention right now?" the moment they open the app. The dashboard surfaces the highest-priority items without requiring manual searching or filtering.
