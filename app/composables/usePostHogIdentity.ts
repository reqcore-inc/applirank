/**
 * Composable that syncs the Better Auth session with PostHog identity.
 * Call once in a root-level layout or app.vue to enable automatic
 * user identification and organization group analytics.
 *
 * Must be called in `<script setup>` context (not in a plugin).
 *
 * Identity and group calls are gated on analytics consent so that events are
 * never sent before the user has opted in.  When a user grants consent during
 * their session (ConsentBanner), the watchers re-fire and identify them
 * immediately without requiring a page reload.
